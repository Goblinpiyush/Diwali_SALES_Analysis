I started with data cleaning to handle missing values and outliers. Then, I performed data transformation and created new features to enhance the analysis. Using pandas, I aggregated the data to derive insights on sales performance across different product categories, regions, and customer segments.The insights from this analysis helped in improving inventory planning and targeted marketing campaigns. By focusing on the high-demand products and the most responsive customer segments, the sales team could strategize more effectively for future promotions and sales events.One of the challenges I faced was dealing with incomplete and inconsistent data. I learned the importance of robust data cleaning techniques and the value of visualizing data to uncover hidden patterns. This project also strengthened my skills in data analysis and visualization using Python.
